You control a player who is trying to escape a maze while being chased by monsters. Your job is to make it past as many levels as possible before the monsters reach you. 

In each level, there is a maze with one exit. You need to move the player through this exit to advance to the next level.

Each level consists of a randomly generated maze. As you progess in levels, the maze will get larger, the number of monsters will increase, and the monsters will get smarter.

Controls:
- Arrow keys/WASD to move
- Click and Drag to resize the screen (the game is resizable!)
